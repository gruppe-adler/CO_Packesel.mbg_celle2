--- ENGIMA'S TRAFFIC (VER 1.30) ---

Engima's Traffic is a set of scripts that adds traffic to an Arma 3 mission.

Vehicles of different types are spawned in out of sight for the player(s). They get a waypoint to a random road segment 
on the map, but are removed at a certain distance from the nearest player.

Script can run different isntances of traffic, with different customized behaviors, simultaneously. For example, you 
can run one script that puts a lot of civilians on the entire map, and one more that simultaneously control a few enemy armored 
vehicles in one area and friendly vehicles in another (see USING MORE THAN ONE INSTANCE below).

Script works in singleplayer, multiplayer, hosted, dedicated for JIPs, and on any map (at least official if it has roads).


--- CUSTOMIZATION ---

The script can be customized for different behaviors. Customize a script by editing the startup parameters. The startup 
parameters list is an array of key value pairs. A key value pair is a small array where the key object is a string 
with the name of the parameter setting and the value object is the actual value.

Here is the simplest example that starts the traffic script with all default parameters (civilian traffic). This code are to 
be put in Engima\Traffic\ConfigAndStart.sqf.

[] spawn ENGIMA_TRAFFIC_StartTraffic;

Here is an example that uses all parameters and first saves them in a variable named "_parameters". The function call (or spawn) 
that starts the traffic is beneath. This code are to be put in Engima\Traffic\ConfigAndStart.sqf.

// Set traffic parameters.
_parameters = [
	["SIDE", civilian],
	["VEHICLES", ["C_Offroad_01_F", "C_Offroad_01_repair_F", "C_Quadbike_01_F", "C_Hatchback_01_F", "C_Hatchback_01_sport_F", "C_SUV_01_F", "C_Van_01_transport_F", "C_Van_01_box_F", "C_Van_01_fuel_F"]],
	["VEHICLES_COUNT", 10],
	["MIN_SPAWN_DISTANCE", 800],
	["MAX_SPAWN_DISTANCE", 1200],
	["MIN_SKILL", 0.4],
	["MAX_SKILL", 0.6],
	["AREA_MARKER", "EnemyMarker1"],
	["HIDE_AREA_MARKER", true],
	["ON_SPAWN_CALLBACK", { hint ("Vehicle of type " + typeOf (_this select 0) + " created!")],
	["ON_REMOVE_CALLBACK", { hint "Vehicle of type " + typename _this + " removed!"; }],
	["DEBUG", true]
];

// Start an instance of the traffic
_parameters spawn ENGIMA_TRAFFIC_StartTraffic;

Here is a complete list of the parameters and what they do:

* SIDE (Side): Which side the spawned vehicles will be. Can be east, west, independent or civilian.

* VEHICLES (Array): Array of vehicle classes that may be spawned. If you want to see more of one vehicle than another, 
  then have it occur a couple of more often in the array. The following example will spawn traffic where 75% of vehicles 
  are quadbikes and 25% is transports:
  Example: ["C_Quadbike_01_F", "C_Quadbike_01_F", "C_Quadbike_01_F", "C_Van_01_transport_F"]
  
* VEHICLES_COUNT (Number): Number of vehicles that exists on the map for the current traffic instance.
  Example: If VEHICLES_COUNT is set to 10 and MAX_SPAWN_DISTANCE is set to 1000, then there will be 10 vehicles on an area 
  of 3142 square meters (1000 * pi).

* MIN_SPAWN_DISTANCE (Number): Minimum spawn distance in meters from nearest human player on the map. Should be at least 100 
  meters less than MAX_SPAWN_DISTANCE.
  Example: 800

* MAX_SPAWN_DISTANCE (Number): Maximum spawn distance in meters from nearest player on the map. Vehicles beyond this 
  distance will be removed. Should be at least 100 meters greater than MIN_SPAWN_DISTANCE.
  Example: 1200
  
* MIN_SKILL (Number): Vehicle crew's minimum skill. Must be between 0 and 1 and less than or equal to MAX_SKILL. Actual 
  skill of each spawned vehicle (and crew) will be a random number between MIN_SKILL and MAX_SKILL.
  Example: 0.4

* MAX_SKILL (Number): Vehicle crew's maximum skill. Must be between 0 and 1 and greater than or equal to MIN_SKILL. Actual 
  skill of each spawned vehicle (and crew) will be a random number between MIN_SKILL and MAX_SKILL.
  Example: 0.6
  
* AREA_MARKER (String): Name of a marker that sets bounds for the traffic. The marker needs to be of shape rectancle or
  ellipse (not icon for obvious reasons), and it needs to contains road segments. All vehicles for the current traffic 
  will spawn inside this area, and all waypoints set to these vehicles will also be inside the area. However, it is Arma
  that routes the vehicle to the destination, and so it can come to decide to use roads that are outside of the marker. Be
  aware of this when you are planning the marker positions. Default value is an empty string ("") which means "the entire 
  map".
  
* HIDE_AREA_MARKER (Boolean): Wether the area marker should be hidden or not. If true then the marker will be hidden on 
  the map for the players, otherwise it will be visible. Default value is true.

* ON_SPAWN_CALLBACK (Code): Code that is executed when a vehicle has spawned. Parameter _this is an array: 0: created 
  vehicle (Object), 1: all crew (Array of Objects), 2: vehicle's group (Group). Default value is {}.
  Example: { hint ("Vehicle of type " + typeOf (_this select 0) + " created!")

* ON_REMOVE_CALLBACK (Code): Code that is executed just before a vehicle is removed. Vehicle is sent in as a parameter _this.
  Default value is {}.
  Example: { hint "Vehicle of type " + typename _this + " removed!"; }

* DEBUG (Boolean): Whether script is running in debug mode or not. In debug mode all vehicles are marked as dots on the map.
  Can be true or false. Default value is false.


- USING MORE THAN ONE INSTANCE -

To excecute more instances of the script simultaneously, copy the parameters and the start spawn command in 
Engima\Traffic\ConfigAndStart.sqf and adding them at bottom of the ConfigAndStart.sqf. It is important that all calls to 
ENGIMA_TRAFFIC_startTraffic is made within two seconds. Otherwise the map's road segments will not be initialzied as 
needed.
